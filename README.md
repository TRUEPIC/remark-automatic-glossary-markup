# Remark Automatic Glossary Markup 

[remark-automatic-glossary-markup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-automatic-glossary-markup)

This is a simple and straightforward remark plugin that, when given a list of glossary terms, will wrap the first occurance of that term within a paragraph of the markdown file within a link.  That link will be to `#glossary-${urlEncodedGlossaryTerm}` which you can then use to drive your glossary behavior.

You must provide the terms that you would like to be marked up to this plugin like this:

```js
import remark from "remark";
import remarkAutomaticGlossaryMarkup from "remark-automatic-glossary-markup";

remark().use(remarkAutomaticGlossaryMarkup, {
  terms: [{ term: "API" }, { term: "JSON" }],
});
```
